# System-Integration-and-Architecture

## Expectations in this subject.

I only have a basic understanding of systems, business processes, and software, which means i have to learn more in this subject. What I expect is to gain a better picture of how different systems and platforms function together. While I already know a some things about systems and the tools used in building them, my knowledge is still very limited. Through this subject, I hope to explore the deeper concepts and discover how everything is connected.

I also expect to gain more practical knowledge about system design and integration. Right now, I only know the basics, so I’m excited to learn how actually build and connect systems in the real world. I think this subject will help me understand how different applications communicate, how businesses take advantage of these systems to improve their processes. I also hope to learn about the compatibility issues and security concerns, and how they are solved. By gaining this kind of knowledge, I believe I’ll be more prepared to handle real-life situations.

Overall, I expect that this subject will help me more and allow me to become more confident in applying what I learn. I want to understand the bigger picture of how systems work together and how integration plays a important role in making processes more efficient. I also believe that what I gain here will prepare me for future projects and also in my career in IT, where these skills are highly important. Even though I still consider myself a beginner, I see this subject as an opportunity to grow, build a strong foundation, and open doors to more advanced learning and practical experiences.
